## openinfer-synth

Synthesis pipeline for lowering validated graphs into static, device-specific
source code for edge targets. Planned outputs include C, CUDA, Vulkan, and
VHDL/HLS-style flows.

### Status
This submodule is a placeholder for now; there is no active build or test
pipeline. See the main repo for current status and roadmap.
